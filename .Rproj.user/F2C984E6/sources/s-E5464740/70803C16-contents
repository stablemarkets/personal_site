Iâ€™m a biostatistics PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. I am also an Associate Fellow at the [LDI](https://ldi.upenn.edu/). For the most part, my research centers around developing Bayesian nonparametric methods for causal inference problems. Before Penn, I was a senior analyst at [Analysis Group](https://www.analysisgroup.com/practices/epidemiology-and--biostatistics/).

I blog about statistics, bayesian methods, computation/MCMC, visualization, and other things that happen to interest me.
