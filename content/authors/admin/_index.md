# Bio
I am currently an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at Brown University's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/home). My methodological research centers around developing [Bayesian methods for flexible causal effect estimation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.8761) with observational data. These methods blend principled causal reasoning, nonparametric Bayesian modeling, and efficient computation to build systems for data-driven decision making.

Many of my motivating applications are in oncology - e.g. [Bayesian nonparametric cost](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/biom.13244) and cost-efficacy estimation for endometrial cancer treatments; Developing a Bayesian bootstrap procedure for assessing [treatment effect heterogeneity](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ijb-2022-0051/html) of photon therapy across cancer types. My current research is partially funded by [a PCORI grant](https://www.pcori.org/research-results/2022/statistical-methods-optimizing-dynamic-patient-level-treatment-and-monitoring-strategies) and focuses on developing Bayesian semiparametric methods for estimating and optimizing effects of sequential treatment strategies with applications in leukemia.

I received my PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Jason Roy and Nandita Mitra. Here you will find a link to my CV and a selection of some past and current research, talks, etc. I sometimes blog about statistics, Bayesian methods, computation/MCMC, and other things I happen to stumble upon during research.
