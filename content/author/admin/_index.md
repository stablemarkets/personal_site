Iâ€™m a biostatistics PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, an Associate Fellow at the [LDI](https://ldi.upenn.edu/), and a member of the [Center for Causal Inference](https://www.cceb.med.upenn.edu/cci). My research centers around developing Bayesian nonparametric methods with applications to health economics, prediction, and causal inference problems. Before Penn, I was a Senior Analyst at [Analysis Group](https://www.analysisgroup.com/practices/epidemiology-and--biostatistics/)'s health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) group.

I blog about statistics, bayesian methods, computation/MCMC, visualization, and other things I happen to stumble upon during research.
