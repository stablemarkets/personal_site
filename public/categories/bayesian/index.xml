      <description>Motivation Model Set Up Data Augmentation Metropolis-in-Gibbs Sampler Simulation Example in R   Motivation When dealing with time-to-event data, right-censoring is a common occurance. Although most are familiar with likelihood construction under right-censoring (and corresponding frequentist estimation), there’s very little available online about Bayesian approaches even for fully parametric models. Here I’ll briefly outline a Bayesian estimation procedure for a Weibull model with right-censoring. The estimation procedure is MCMC based using a data augmentation approach.</description>
