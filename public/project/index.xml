      <title>Non-parametric Bayes</title>

      <description>Bayesian nonparametrics is a powerful class of methods including Gaussian processes, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), Gamma Processes, Dirichlet Process, etc. The central idea is to abstract away from parameters. For instance, standard methods may assume a regression function is linear, indexed by finitely many slope/intercept parameters. A prior on these finitely many parameters then induces a prior on the regression function. To avoid specifying such restrictive functional form, we need to cut out the middle-man (the parameters) and specify priors over the function directly.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Causal Inference</title>

      <description>Causal inference is broadly concerned with estimating parameters governing the causal mechanisms between an intervention or treatment of interest and an outcome. Causal inference provides a framework for 1) constructing different estimands that have explicitly causal, rather than associational, interpretations 2) formulating the assumptions under which we can estimate these using observed data, 3) devising sensitivity analyses around violations of these assumptions, and 4) making valid inferences about these estimans. These are just some of the many advances made in the causal literature.</description>

      <title>Applied Causal and Bayesian Modeling</title>

      <description>Below is a collection of some applied work with particularly interesting Bayesian and/or causal modeling. For instance, Hubbard et al. use a Bayesian mixture model to infer patients&amp;rsquo; unknown diabetes status in noisy EHR data. Harrison et al. use a Bayesian hierarchical zero-inflated model to assess difference in costs associated with a cost-lowering healthcare intervention. Takvorian et al. use a difference-in-differences strategy to assess the impact of medicare expansion under ACA on cancer treatment delivery.</description>
