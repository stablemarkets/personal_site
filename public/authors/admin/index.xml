      <description>I am a 5th year biostatistics PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, an Associate Fellow at the LDI, and a member of the Center for Causal Inference. My research centers around developing Bayesian nonparametric methods with applications to health economics, prediction, and causal inference problems. Before Penn, I was a Senior Analyst at Analysis Group&amp;rsquo;s health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) group.
Here you will find a link to my full CV and a selection of some past and current research work.</description>
