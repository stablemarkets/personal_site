      <description>Iâ€™m a biostatistics PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, an Associate Fellow at the LDI, and a member of the Center for Causal Inference. My research centers around developing Bayesian nonparametric methods with applications to health economics, prediction, and causal inference problems. Before Penn, I was a Senior Analyst at Analysis Group&amp;rsquo;s health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) group.
I blog about statistics, bayesian methods, computation/MCMC, visualization, and other things I happen to stumble upon during research.</description>
