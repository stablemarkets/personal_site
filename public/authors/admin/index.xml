      <description>I am a 5th year biostatistics PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, an Associate Fellow at the LDI, and a member of the Center for Causal Inference. I recently passed my dissertation defense and will be joining Brown University&amp;rsquo;s Department of Biostatistics as an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) in July 2021.
My methodological research centers around developing nonparametric Bayesian methods for flexibly estimating causal effects with observational data. This involves, among other things, devising priors over high-dimensional model spaces and constructing MCMC methods for efficient posterior computation.</description>
