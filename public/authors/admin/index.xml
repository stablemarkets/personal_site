      <description>I am a 5th year biostatistics PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, an Associate Fellow at the LDI, and a member of the Center for Causal Inference. My methodological research centers around developing nonparametric Bayesian methods for flexibly estimating causal effects with observational data. This involves, among other things, devising methods for efficient posterior computation via MCMC. Though broadly applicable, these methodological interests are particularly motivated by applied problems in health economics and, more recently, oncology.</description>
