      <description>Iâ€™m a biostatistics PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. I am also an Associate Fellow at the LDI and a member of of the Center for Causal Inference. For the most part, my research centers around developing Bayesian nonparametric methods for causal inference problems. Before Penn, I was a senior analyst at Analysis Group.
I blog about statistics, bayesian methods, computation/MCMC, visualization, and other things that happen to interest me.</description>
